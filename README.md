# United-States-Road-Accident-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Road accidents significantly threaten public safety
and require in-depth analysis for effective prevention and mitigation
strategies. This project focuses on predicting accidents
through the examination of a comprehensive traffic dataset covering
49 states in the United States. The dataset integrates information
from diverse sources, including transportation departments,
law enforcement, and traffic sensors. This paper specifically emphasizes
predicting the number of accidents, utilizing advanced
machine learning models such as regression analysis and time
series analysis. The inclusion of various factors, ranging from
environmental conditions to human behavior and infrastructure,
ensures a holistic understanding of the dynamics influencing
road safety. Temporal and spatial analysis further allows for
the identification of trends, seasonal variations, and high-risk
areas. The implications of this research extend to proactive
decision-making for policymakers and transportation authorities.
By providing accurate predictions and quantifiable insights into
expected accident rates under different conditions, the paper
aims to empower authorities to allocate resources efficiently and
implement targeted interventions. The goal is to contribute to the
development of informed policies and interventions that enhance
road safety, creating a safer environment for all road users.
